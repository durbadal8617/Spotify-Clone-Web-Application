# Spotify-Clone-Web-Application

Built a responsive front-end clone of Spotify using HTML and CSS, replicating key UI
components such as the navigation bar, playlists, and media player layout. The project
focused on visual accuracy, layout structuring, and cross-device responsiveness,
showcasing strong fundamentals in semantic HTML, CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries.
